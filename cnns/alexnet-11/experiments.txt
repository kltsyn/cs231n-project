Run 1:

test_iter = 1000
test_interval = 1000
base_lr = 0.0001
gamma = 0.1
stepsize = 1000
weight_decay = 0.0005
solver_type = ADAGRAD

accuracy after about 9k iterations (on val/bicycle only) = 0.75 (didn't change at all throughout the 9k iterations)

loss after 9k iterations = between 0.17 and 0.28

------------------------

Run 2:

test_iter = 30
test_interval = 200
base_lr = 0.0005
gamma = 0.1
stepsize = 500
weight_decay = 0.0005
solver_type = ADAGRAD
